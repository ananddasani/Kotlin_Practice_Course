# Kotlin_Practice_Course

Hey there!!

This is a Kotlin Language Practice repo where you can easily learn Kotlin Language which is prerequisite for my up coming course **Android Development using Kotlin**

Hope you already have access to my **[Andrid Development using Java Course](https://github.com/ananddasani/Android_Apps)** 

If not, I would strongly recommend you to have a tour of it :)
